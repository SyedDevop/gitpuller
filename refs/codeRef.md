If the folder you're trying to download from GitHub contains subfolders, you'll need to modify the approach slightly to handle this. Essentially, you need to recursively navigate through each subfolder and download its contents. Here's an outline of the steps:

1. **Check if an Item is a File or Subfolder**: When you list the contents of a folder using `RepositoriesService.GetContents`, you need to check each `RepositoryContent` object to determine whether it's a file or a subfolder.

2. **For Files**: Download them as in the previous example.

3. **For Subfolders**: Recursively call a function to list and download their contents.

Here's an updated version of the example code that handles subfolders:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "net/http"
    "os"
    "path/filepath"

    "github.com/google/go-github/github"
    "golang.org/x/oauth2"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    ts := oauth2.StaticTokenSource(
        &oauth2.Token{AccessToken: "<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>"},
    )
    tc := oauth2.NewClient(ctx, ts)

    client := github.NewClient(tc)

    owner := "<REPO_OWNER>"
    repo := "<REPO_NAME>"
    path := "<FOLDER_PATH>"

    downloadFolder(ctx, client, owner, repo, path, "")
}

func downloadFolder(ctx context.Context, client *github.Client, owner, repo, path, dest string) {
    // Get contents of the folder
    contents, _, _, err := client.Repositories.GetContents(ctx, owner, repo, path, nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    for _, content := range contents {
        switch *content.Type {
        case "file":
            downloadFile(ctx, content, dest)
        case "dir":
            newDest := filepath.Join(dest, *content.Name)
            os.MkdirAll(newDest, os.ModePerm)
            downloadFolder(ctx, client, owner, repo, *content.Path, newDest)
        }
    }
}

func downloadFile(ctx context.Context, content *github.RepositoryContent, dest string) {
    fmt.Println("Downloading:", *content.Name)

    // Get the download URL
    downloadURL, err := content.GetDownloadURL()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Get the data
    resp, err := http.Get(downloadURL)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // Create the file
    out, err := os.Create(filepath.Join(dest, *content.Name))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer out.Close()

    // Write the body to file
    _, err = io.Copy(out, resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

In this code:

- The `downloadFolder` function is now recursive. It checks if each item in the folder is a file or a directory.
- If it's a file

, it calls `downloadFile` to download it.

- If it's a directory (subfolder), it makes a new directory on the local file system (if needed) and then calls itself (`downloadFolder`) recursively to handle the contents of the subfolder.

This way, the script navigates through all levels of the folder structure, downloading all files within each folder and subfolder. Again, ensure to replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>`, `<REPO_OWNER>`, `<REPO_NAME>`, and `<FOLDER_PATH>` with your actual details.

Keep in mind that this script is a basic example. Depending on your needs, you might want to add more robust error handling, logging, or other features. Also, make sure that the GitHub API token you use has the necessary permissions to access the repository contents.
